# beadgame

Implementation of the chainshot game written in Clojure!

All the ladies love Clojure!

## Usage


To compile the code and package it into a jar, just run:  
    ` lein uberjar ` 

Or you can just run the standalone jar that's included in the target.  
    ` java -jar target/beadgame-0.1.0-standalone.jar `  

When you start the game it will ask you for an initial board file, this board file is a space delimited columns, new lime delimited rows. You can use any colours.
Example initial boards are provided as startBoard, startBoard2 ... 

The game will explain the rest of the instructions
